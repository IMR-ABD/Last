							<p>Marvel Studios has debuted a new behind-the-scenes look at Doctor Strange! Open your mind and check out the video below.

Doctor Strange stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams (The Vow), Michael Stuhlbarg (Pawn Sacrifice), Scott Adkins (The Bourne Ultimatum), and Amy Landecker (Transparent). The film is directed by Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Deliver Us From Evil) from a script by Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Passengers) and C. Robert Cargill (Sinister). </p>

							<p>The film follows the story of the talented neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange who, after a tragic car accident, must put ego aside and learn the secrets of a hidden world of mysticism and alternate dimensions. Based in New York City’s Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel cinematic universe.

Doctor Strange continues “Phase Three” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, picking up in the wake of this year’s Captain America: Civil War. Catch it in regular and IMAX 3D theaters on Friday, November 4.

							<p>Ride Along 3 is in development with series screenwriter Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, reports TheWrap. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are expected to reprise the roles of James Payton and Ben Barber, respectively.

“We’re writing the script right now, we’re writing away and basically, I’m waiting to see some pages and we’re excited for the idea and what it can be and of course bringing Kevin [Hart] and Ice Cube back together because they are the greatest odd couple in the world,” series director Tim Story told the site. “I’m impatiently waiting for a script to be given to me. We have some great ideas.”
</p>


							<p>The films have earned over $278 million at the worldwide box office. The 2014 first film earned $154.5 million at the global box office on a $25 million budget, while the sequel was released this January and earned $124.2 million worldwide. It was made for $40 million.

The sequel also starred Ken Jeong (“Community,” The Hangover Trilogy), Benjamin Bratt (Despicable Me 2, “Law & Order”), Olivia Munn (“The Newsroom,” X-Men: Apocalypse), Bruce McGill (Collateral, “Rizzoli & Isles”), Tika Sumpter (Ride Along, Salt) and Sherri Shepherd (“The View,” Precious).

Based on characters created by Greg Coolidge, Ride Along 2 was executive produced by Nicolas Stern, Ron Muhammad, Scott Bernstein, Chris Bender and JC Spink.
